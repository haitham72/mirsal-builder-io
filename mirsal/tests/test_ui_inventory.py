"""The redesign's safety net (docs/redesign_plan.md, Haitham 2026-10-10: "I am super scared any logic would be lost").

tests/data/ui_baseline.json is the console as it was before the redesign: every action (`ACT.<name>=`), every screen (`RENDER.<name>=`) and every
server route the page names. While the screens are rebuilt, each of them must still exist, OR be listed in the same file under `renamed`
(old -> new, and the new one must exist) OR under `retired` (name -> why, with Haitham's approval and the date). Nothing disappears silently.
The baseline is never regenerated during the redesign; only `renamed` and `retired` grow."""
