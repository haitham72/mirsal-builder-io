"""The database half of purging a batch (flow/purge.py is the caller): what a purge would remove from Postgres, and removing it.

What the database holds of a batch G### (`migrations/001_init.sql`, `003_pool.sql`): its `generations` row, its `stickers` rows, their `sticker_index` pool rows WITH the `subject_vec` / `action_vec`
embeddings, `assets`, `generation_events`, `video_sheets`, and `reviews` / `tasks` that point at them. There is NO `packs` table: a pack is library.json, so purging a pack never reaches this file.

What goes and what stays (Haitham: "`reviews` rows stay, append-only; a purge does not rewrite history"):
  * gone: the `sticker_index` rows (embeddings included, so the sticker leaves search), the `assets`, the `generation_events`, every `stickers` row no review points at, every `video_sheets` row
    no review or task points at, and the `generations` row itself when nothing at all points at it any more;
  * stays: the `reviews` rows (their foreign keys keep the rows they name alive) and the `tasks` rows (the provider's external task id is the join key to the spend ledger). The kept `stickers` /
    `generations` rows become TOMBSTONES: `status` (and for a sticker `still_review`, `anim_review`, `animation_status`) read `PURGED`, so the pool never indexes them again
    (`pool.reindex` only takes `still_review = 'APPROVED'`) and a search never offers a picture whose file is gone. A purged batch number is never reused (`pipeline.next_gid` reads the ledger).

Everything is best effort in the way the rest of the store is: no database configured, `MIRSAL_DB_WRITE=0`, or an out/ that is not the default one (tests, scratch copies) means `available: False`
and nothing is touched. One transaction; every statement is idempotent, so a purge that stopped half-way is simply run again."""
