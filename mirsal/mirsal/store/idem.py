"""The durable half of idempotency: `Idempotency-Key` answers kept in Postgres for 24 hours (migration 008), behind the cache.

The cache (Redis, or memory when Redis is down) answers first and is what a running server uses. This is what still knows a key after a restart without Redis, so a repeated
click or a retried request never starts a second paid job. Best effort like every write-through: it only works for the real `out/` (the same rule as `sync.enabled`, so tests and
MIRSAL_OUT copies never touch the shared database), never raises, never slows the request (availability is cached per process). The key is stored as its sha256; the FIRST
answer wins; records older than 24 hours are not answered (and are pruned when a new one is written)."""
