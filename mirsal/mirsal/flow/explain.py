"""Plain words for a sheet Python could not use (2026-10-02, the falcon sheet G094).

A sheet that arrives and fails a BLOCK check of the sheet stage leaves a batch whose nine stickers are all FAILED with the same reason. To a person that looked like "the task was
never retrieved" (the sheet WAS downloaded and paid for); this module says what happened, in words, and what to do. Pure: it reads a `result.json` dict and (optionally) a job
dict, it never decides anything. Since 2026-10-02 a layout problem no longer stops a sheet (it is cut anyway, `pipeline.SHEET_PROCEED`); what still stops one is a file that does not open
or a sheet with no key screen, and for the latter the card offers one free click: "Cut it anyway" (`pipeline.recut`)."""
