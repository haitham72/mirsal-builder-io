"""The golden path's review gates (docs/engine-and-studio.md, checkpoint 1F). The rules live here, in Python, and every phase keeps them:

  G1 plan -> sheet -> Python blocks bad cells -> G2 stills -> video sheet (built from the approved stills only) -> G3 video sheet
  -> returned video attached to A<n> -> Python blocks bad slots -> G4 animations -> G5 pack (stickers approved at G2 AND G4)

Python judges what is *correct* and nobody can approve a FAILED sticker as it stands. Telegram's own limits (format, size, codec) and a cell with no picture are final; every other BLOCK is a
judgement call that a human may "use anyway" with a recorded click that can be taken back (`allow_stills`, `allow_animations`, further down), after which the sticker is READY with the check kept
as a warning and the gate lets the person approve it. A human (from Phase 3 the VLM pre-reviews) judges what is *good*. Rejection never deletes. A sticker keeps its original S# through every
stage. Every decision is an event line and a history entry. The UI only displays what is enforced here (a 409 carries the reason)."""
