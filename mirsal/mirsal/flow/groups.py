"""Batch groups (Haitham, 2026-10-04): variations of one idea are ONE family. Earlier batches shows a family as one entry with a strip of its variations, and the
family shares its particles.

A batch's group is derived when it is read, so nothing needs migrating:
- `group: "G104"` in result.json (written by Add to group, or by dragging a batch onto another) names the family's root;
- otherwise the batch follows its recorded `parent` (a chat edit, "more", a redo) to that parent's family;
- otherwise it is its own root.
The target is always the parent: "add X to Y" (or drag X onto Y) puts X and everything in X's family under Y's root. The family is shown with its root's title.
`relation` says why a batch is in its family: `joined` (by hand), `redo` (`regen_of`), `edit` (a `parent`), or None for the root."""
