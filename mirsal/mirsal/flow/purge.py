"""Emptying the trash: the purge of removed batches and deleted packs (Haitham, 2026-10-03: "Cleaning the trash"). Remove batch, Delete pack and a deleted particle set are all SOFT; this is the
one place where something is deleted for good, and it only ever reaches what is already in the trash.

What it does, per item (the order is the resume story: the last thing to go is the thing that makes the item show up in the list, so a purge that stops half-way is simply run again):
  * a BATCH: (1) its Postgres rows (`store/purge_rows.py`: the pool rows with their embeddings, assets, events, stickers and video sheets nothing points at; `reviews` and `tasks` stay,
    the kept rows become `PURGED` tombstones), (2) a ledger line, (3) its whole trash entry `out/trash/batches/G###` + `G###.meta.json`, (4) a second ledger line. Stickers a person
    already added to a pack are copies in the library and stay in their packs.
  * a PACK: (1) its files under `out/library/files/` (a file another pack, live or trashed, also holds stays for that pack), (2) its record in library.json, (3) a ledger line.
    There is no pack row in Postgres (a pack is library.json), so there is nothing to clean there.
Never silent, never partial about what it asks: a sticker file another pack holds, or a batch whose stickers sit in the shared pool (search can offer them to other requests), is REFUSED in words
until the person confirms THAT item (`confirm_shared`); "delete all" never carries that confirmation, it skips such items and says so. A job in flight refuses a batch (409 in words).
"Delete all" needs the typed phrase `purge N` naming how many items it will delete, and the server compares N with the trash as it is NOW.

The record: `out/trash/purged.jsonl`, append-only, one line per phase with `actor: "human"`, who, when, and what went. It is also the memory that keeps a purged batch number taken
(`pipeline.next_gid`), because the database keeps the number's history. `reviews` are never touched.

A purge runs in ONE background thread (`PurgeTask`), never in the request: the route validates, starts it and waits a moment; a small purge answers 200 with the result, a long one 202 and the
caller polls `GET /api/trash/purges/{id}`. The task's state is also written to `out/trash/purge-state.json`; a state that says `running` with no live thread reads `interrupted` and the
items are still in the list. Plain functions over files, library.json and the store; the engine never imports this (CLAUDE.md rule 3)."""
