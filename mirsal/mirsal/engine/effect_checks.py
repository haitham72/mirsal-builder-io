"""Checks for a particle-effect clip (`engine/particles.py`): is it empty at both ends, does it show a burst, does it stay in its cell, does it move; and, for a video drawn from
text, is the key-colour screen behind it ONE flat colour (`screen_flatness`, `seam_line`, `screen_check`: the id `key_is_seamless`).

The verdict is ONLY "PASS" or "WARN", never "BLOCK". This is the owner's standing rule: Python must not hard-block a result he can look at;
he must always be able to use it anyway. A WARN is a line shown next to the preview, not a gate.

What is NOT here: the technical limits of a Telegram video sticker (WEBM/VP9 + alpha, 512x512, 30 fps, 3 s, 256 KB). The existing verifier
(`engine/verify.py`) enforces them on the encoded file; these checks only judge the pixels of the effect itself.

Pure numpy; deterministic; no I/O. Every threshold is a module constant so the UI and the tests read the same numbers.
