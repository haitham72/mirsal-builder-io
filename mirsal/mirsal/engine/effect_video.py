"""Particle effects, the video side: a text-only Kling clip (a grid of burst cells on a key-colour screen, each cell empty at the start and at the end) becomes one Telegram video
sticker per cell. Pure engine code (no database, no model client): `cut_cells` reads the clip, `finish_cell` makes one sticker, `encode_and_check` is shared with the simulated mode.

What is enforced and what is only said (the owner's standing rule, 2026-10-02: never a block a person cannot get past): the Telegram limits (format, size, codec, dimensions, fps,
duration, no audio, alpha) are the only hard failures, because Telegram itself would reject the file. Everything about the effect (it starts empty, it ends empty, it is a burst,
it stays in its cell) is a WARN with the reason, and `settle` repairs the two most common faults by construction (a clip that has not quite emptied by its last frame is faded out;
one that starts with something already on screen is faded in), so the file always ends the way a Telegram effect does."""
