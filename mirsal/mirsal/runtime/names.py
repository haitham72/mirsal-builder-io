    img-my_dog-wave-summer_pack-20261003T081512-5be201.png        (a file made inside the library: the pack is stamped at creation)

Readable and traceable: what it is (media, subject, action), when it was made (UTC), and a short fingerprint that makes the name
non-repeatable even when the same subject and action are made twice in the same second (the fingerprint also carries the generation id,
so two batches never collide). Fields are separated by `-`; inside a field words are joined by `_`, so a name always splits back into its
parts (`parse`). The pack is optional on purpose: it is only known for files born in the library, and a sticker can later move to another
pack, so the pack of a generation's sticker lives in the library's data, never in its file name.

Names made before this convention (`img-005-barbie_love-barbie_blow_kiss`: media, the generation number, the task, the key) are never renamed;
`parse` reads both and says which (`legacy`). The still and its animation share one stem, only the media letters and the extension differ."""
