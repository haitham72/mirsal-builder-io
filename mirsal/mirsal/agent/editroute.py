"""What an edit request MEANS, by rules (the UI/UX spec P11-P13). Pure: no model, no files, no network.

The agent used to treat "can you make him iron man?" as a NEW request (and mangle it into the subject "can you him iron man"), answered "can you rotate him?" with a refusal from the model, and sent
no picture with any edit. Every request about what is on screen now falls into exactly one of:

    route "editor"   a transformation or a cleaning of ONE slice (rotate, flip, crop, remove the stray lines, add a text): the image editor does it, nothing is generated, nothing is spent.
    route "regen"    the picture has to be drawn again, and how it is sent depends on which of three things the person means:
        case "tweak"      (a) I like the image, change a detail (move its hand, make him cry, her blonde, a hijab, remove the skyline, make it cartoonish, cuter):
                          the SHEET goes as the picture, with the parent's prompt and only that change.
        case "action"     (b) the same image, a new action ("now make him play football"): the shape absolutely stays, the action changes: the sheet goes as the picture, the prompt's actions change.
        case "redesign"   (c) the same subject and actions with another design ("nice, now make it as a lemon", "make him iron man"): the actions are approved, the design is replaced:
                          NO picture is sent, the parent's prompt is reused with the new subject.

`classify_edit` returns None for anything that is not an edit of what is open ("make me a falcon" is a new request). `plan_for` writes the case into a COPY of the parent's stored plan; the picture
and the sentence that tells the image model what to keep go with it (`REF_CLAUSES`). The subject of the turn ("iron man") is the subject the new batch is saved under, so the next turn knows it."""
