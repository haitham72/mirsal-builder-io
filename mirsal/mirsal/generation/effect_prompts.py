"""Prompts of the particle effects: the text Kling gets for a text-only burst video, built by code from a small plan (template-locked: a model or a person fills the JSON, `lint_plan`
checks it, `video_prompt` writes the text, so the prompt can never drift or smuggle in anything else).

A burst effect is what Telegram does when you press an emoji: it starts from NOTHING, the particles burst out of the centre, grow a little, then gravity takes them down until the
screen is empty again. So the video has no start image (nothing to start from) and every burst must begin and end empty. The screen colour is the engine's key colour: green,
unless a particle of the effect is itself green (leaves, grass, a frog): then blue, so the keyer does not eat the particles.

The rule of the video text (version 2, Haitham 2026-10-03, after Kling drew boxes, walls and panels from the words "cell", "grid" and "square frame"): the layout is only ever said as
POSITION NAMES (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), the whole picture is ONE seamless flat key-colour background described once and positively, and no word that names
a shape or a division is used: square, frame, poster, screen, box, cell, grid, panel, section, tile, border, divider, split, layout, invisible (`BANNED_WORDS`, a test builds every
template text and looks). Aspect ratio and size are request parameters, never words. The clip that comes back is measured for exactly that (`engine/effect_checks.py`, `key_is_seamless`).
These words are forbidden in the TEMPLATE text only: a person's own particle names are not policed for them.

`TEMPLATE_ID` / `VERSION` are stored with every effect and every job (`request.effect`); a new wording is a new version, a used one is never edited: version 1 stays buildable
(`video_prompt(..., version=1)`) so a stored job can still be read and rebuilt."""
