"""A wide bank of expressive emotions for the built-in (no-AI) sets. Every entry is (key suffix, label, emoji, motion):
the label is the expression plus body language the image model draws; the motion is what the video model animates.
`pick` chooses one entry per mood group, deterministically from the request text, so the same request always gives the same
nine, different requests give different mixes, and a sheet never repeats a mood."""
