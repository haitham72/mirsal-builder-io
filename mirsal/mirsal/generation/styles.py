"""Style presets: what the user picks next to the subject. `phrase` is the text the saved templates plug into the prompt (the word
"sticker" is deliberately never used: image models answer it with a white die-cut border). `hint` is the short line under the tile in the UI.
A tile image is optional: drop <id>.png/.jpg/.webp/.svg into mirsal/console/assets/styles/ and it replaces the placeholder (an abstract swatch, console/placeholders.py:
any preset added here gets one without further work). The Studio reads this list from the API, so a new preset appears there with no UI change."""
