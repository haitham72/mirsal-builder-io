"""The durable job queue (Postgres `job_queue`, migration 007) and the workers that drain it.

Why: until now a provider job was a file fulfilled by a thread of the server, so a server restart lost the follow-up (and the wait). With `MIRSAL_JOB_MODE=queue` the server only
*enqueues* a job; any number of `python -m mirsal worker` processes claim it (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`: two workers never get the same one), run `jobs.fulfil` on it and mark the row;
the server's ingest loop then follows up every DONE job exactly once (sheet -> the stills run, video -> slice) and survives restarts because that state is in the table.

The rules that keep it safe with a paid provider:
- `out/jobs/J###.json` is the truth for the request, the ticket and the result. The row says only who runs it and when.
- **A provider failure is never retried automatically** (a retry can spend credits): the job file is FAILED, the row is FAILED, and a human retries it (`mirsal queue retry J004`, or the Studio's retry).
- Only the worker's *own* trouble is retried, with backoff (30 s, 60 s, ...), up to `max_attempts`, then the row is DEAD. A job whose ticket is already stored resumes by that ticket, so a worker that
  died while waiting does not pay twice.
- One paid call at a time across every process (`jobs.fulfil` takes a file lock under out/), exactly as with threads: workers add durability and isolation, not paid concurrency.
