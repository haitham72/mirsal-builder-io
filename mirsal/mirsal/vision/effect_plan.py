"""The smart step of a particle effect: what bursts out of THIS sticker.

Telegram's effect for a heart is hearts, for a strawberry strawberries: it is never the picture itself flying about. For a Batman sticker the burst is bat signals and bats, for a
jewelry sticker small gold bars and diamonds, for a cat paws, ears and fish: the objects the sticker is ABOUT. A vision model reads each sticker and answers with a small JSON
(subject, pieces, mood); code lints it (`generation/effect_prompts.lint_plan`), groups stickers of the same subject (a pack of eight Superman poses is ONE group, so it costs one sprite
sheet or one video), and picks a motion that fits each mood. Without a model, or when it answers nonsense, a built-in table of about a hundred common emoji and subjects answers instead
and the result says so (`by: "lexicon"`). Nothing is sent to a model without consent (`vision/consent.py`), exactly like the captions; nothing here approves anything."""
