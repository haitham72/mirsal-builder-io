-- A durable job queue for the workers (`python -m mirsal worker`). out/jobs/J###.json stays the truth for a job's request, ticket and result; this table is only who runs it and when.
-- QUEUED (waiting; also after a retry with backoff) -> RUNNING (a worker holds it) -> DONE | FAILED | DEAD.
--   FAILED = the provider reported a failure: never retried automatically (a retry can spend credits); a human retries it.
--   DEAD   = the worker itself kept failing (it died, the disk was full, ...) past max_attempts.
-- A DONE job still has to be followed up by the server (start the stills run, slice the video): ingested_at says it was, ingest_locked_at is a short lease. Re-runnable.
